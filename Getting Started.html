<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>Okay I do not want to overload all of this with information but I will be explaining the best to my ability and yes these tutrials are intended to help everyone become a developer. So now lets just begin so you may know or may not know that in order to create an IOS app a person must have a Mac with xcode installed but the beauty of creating cydia tweaks is that you can create them on your iPhone, Windows PC and a Mac. </br>
	To setup the development environment we must use theos and I will be exaplaining how to install theos on a mobile phone and this may not yet fully work on IOS 9 but this is how you do it. </p>

	<h4>On iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch</h4>

	<p> <ol>
		<li> First add these sources in Cydia which are: </br>
			http://coolstar.org/publicrepo/ </br>
			http://nix.howett.net/theos/ </li>

			<li> Next install these packages from cydia which are </br>
				<br>theos</br>
				<br>Perl</br>
				<br>Git</br> 
				<br>Darwin CC Tools (By Coolstar)</br>
				<br>IOS Toolchain</br>
				<br>BigBoss Reccomended Tools</br>
				<br>Mobile Terminal</br>
				<br>iFile</br>
			</li>

			<li> Next you want to download the IOS SDK and you can get this from <a href="http://iphone.howett.net/sdks">Here</a> and once the sdk has been downloaded you want to proceed to the next step</li>

			<li> Now you want to open up iFile and navigate to "/var/theos" and in "var/theos" you want to create a new folder called "sdks" and once you have done this you then find your sdk file and copy that file and paste it in "/var/theos/sdks" and once this is done you would need to extract the file and this may take a few mins and once this is done you should have the SDK</li>

		<li> Now open up Mobile Terminal and login as root as you can do this by entering "su" followed by the password "alpine" (if you have not  changed the pasword) and after you are logged in as root you may enter the command "$THEOS/bin/nic.pl" and it should display all of the templates and if this is done then congrats you have theos setup on your device </li>

	</ol>
